## Description

Travel{err} is a full CRUD application using the MEAN stack. It allows users to organize their travel experiences or search for destinations based on a criteria they are looking for.

The file structure adheres to the MVC structure, with the Views folder being switched out for the Public one so Angular works.  Authorization was built in, so there are multiple models and controllers working together in the application.  The challenge was to build it as a team.

## Technologies Used

Travel{err} was built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, AngularJS, HTML, and CSS.

## Approach Taken

We mapped out our basic idea with a flowchart.  This helped us identify how the user would move through the application.  Which part would be open and which part would be restricted to users that were logged in.  We identified how we wanted to link the different pages so that the user could move around inside the app.

We used a mockup to be able to visualize our final product. This was a helpful tool for breaking up the workload, helping us see sections for which we could create partials.  This allowed us to work on different files at the same time.

We used Zenhub to organize our workload.  This tool helped us map out each user story, as well as the steps needed to build up our application.  We separated the stories into epics, and this allowed us to see where we stood in the larger project picture.

## User Stories

A user is able to use Travel{err} with or without signing up. If a user decides not to sign up, they are free to browse any destination that has been added by signed in members. They have full functionality to search and view all of the details.

If a user decides to sign up for Travel{err}, they are notified that their account was created successfully and prompted to log in. Once they log in they are redirected back to the home page. The top navigation has an option to add a destination, an option that is not available to a user that is not logged in. A logged in user also has the option to edit or delete a destination.
