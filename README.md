## Description

## Technologies Used

Travel{err} was built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, AngularJS, HTML, and CSS. 

## Approach Taken

The goal was to build a single page application using the MEAN stack: Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and AngularJS.  The file structure adheres to the MVC structure, with the Views folder being switched out for the Public one so Angular works.  Authorization was built in, so there are multiple models and controllers working together in the application.  The challenge was to build it as a team.
