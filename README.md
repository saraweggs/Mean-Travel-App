## Description

The goal was to build a single page application using the MEAN stack: Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and AngularJS.  The file structure adheres to the MVC structure, with the Views folder being switched out for the Public one so Angular works.  Authorization was built in, so there are multiple models and controllers working together in the application.  The challenge was to build it as a team.

## Technologies Used

Travel{err} was built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, AngularJS, HTML, and CSS.

## Approach Taken

We mapped out our basic idea with a flowchart.  This helped us identify how the user would move through the application.  Which part would be open and which part would be restricted to users that were logged in.  We identified how we wanted to link the different pages so that the user could move around inside the app.

We used a mockup to be able to visualize our final product. This was a helpful tool for breaking up the workload, helping us see sections for which we could create partials.  This allowed us to work on different files at the same time.

## User Stories
User can view all of the places listed.  If the user clicks on the image or name, the details will appear adjacent to it. The user can also search through the listings based on their input choice, or using the filters provided. 

Users can create accounts and then log in to have access to increased functionality.  They can create a listing, edit or delete one.
